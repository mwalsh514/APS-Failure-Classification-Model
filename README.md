## **Project Overview**
- ### Objective
    - The objective of this project is to create a classification model capable of accurately predicting the event of a failure of the Air Pressure System (APS) of a Scania truck.
- ### Relevance 
    - A model capable of accurate prediction of APS failure could be utilized in a predictive maintenance scheme.
    - The capability to make accurate predictions of eventual system failure could decrease the need for reactive maintenance.

## **Dataset**
- ### Source
    - This project uses data from APS Failure at Scania Trucks [Dataset]. (2016). UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://doi.org/10.24432/C51S51.
- ### Summary 
    - Real data is divided into training and testing datasets. 
    - The true feature names of this dataset have been replaced by a combination of identifier and bin id (identifier_bin) for proprietary reasons.
