## **Project Overview**
- ### Objective
    - The objective of this project is to create a classification model capable of accurately predicting the event of a failure of the Air Pressure System (APS) of a Scania truck.
- ### Relevance 
    - A model capable of accurate prediction of APS failure could be utilized in a predictive maintenance 

## **Dataset**
- ### Data Access
    - This project uses data from APS Failure at Scania Trucks [Dataset]. (2016). UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://doi.org/10.24432/C51S51.
    - Please download 'aps_failure_training_set.csv' and 'aps_failure_test_set.csv' and place in the 'data' folder.
